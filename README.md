## Features

- **Static Layout**: The project recreates a portion of the Amazon.in homepage, focusing on the header, product grid, and footer.
- **Product Listings**: Sample products with static images and prices are displayed in a grid format.
- **Basic Navigation Bar**: Includes a static search bar and dropdown menus similar to the Amazon website.
- **Carousel**: A static image carousel showcasing promotional banners without interactivity.
- **Desktop-Only Design**: This project is optimized exclusively for desktop screens with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd amazon-clone
    ```
3. No external dependencies are required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the project, open the `index.html` file to view the non-responsive Amazon.in clone in your web browser. This project does not include any backend or server-side logic and is purely for front-end visual purposes.

- Open the project in any modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
- Ensure that your screen resolution is set to **1920x1080** for the best viewing experience.
- If viewed on a smaller screen size, elements might overlap or distort due to the **non-responsive** nature of the code.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: The structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, positioning, and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Basic scripts to add minimal interactivity (e.g., dropdown menus).
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used in navigation and product displays.

## Limitations

This project has several limitations, especially in terms of design and functionality:

- **Non-Responsive Layout**: The layout is fixed for a screen resolution of **1920x1080** pixels. It is not optimized for smaller screen sizes, including mobile or tablet devices. Elements like the navbar, product grid, and images may break or overlap when viewed on non-standard resolutions.
- **No Interactivity**: The carousel is static and does not rotate automatically. Navigation elements such as the search bar and dropdown menus are non-functional.
- **Dummy Data**: The product listings do not link to real items. They only serve as placeholders for visual representation.
- **No Backend**: This project does not include a backend or database, so there is no functionality for adding products to a cart, making purchases, or logging in.
